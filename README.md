EventCMS

This project is to create a CMS for managing events. 
Admins should be able to add/delete/update events and there will
be API-endpoints for the frontend where users can choose to
participate in certain events.

Underneath the CMS there will be a custom framework, the only off-the-shelf
modules used in this project are:
- Twig (a templating engine)
- phpdotenv (for retrieving env variables)
- psr interfaces
